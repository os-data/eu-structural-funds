# Describe the source that you found:
# ----------------------------------
#
# title: a short description of your data source.
#
# description: the place to put your notes, warnings, remarks and limitations
#              about the data are especially important to communicate.
#
# sources: only meant as *documention*. Add as many as you want. The urls to
#          the actual data-files are in the "resources" section.
#
# image: used to illustrate the data source on the website. Check its license.
#
# contributors: Put yourself down(email and website are not obligatory).
#               Follow the simple formatting convention.
#
# resources: a single source can have one or more data-files, called
#            "resources". Why? Because there may be regular data updates or
#            the data may be broken down by funds for example.
#
# Good luck!

  # Describe each data-file:
  # ------------------------
  #
  # title: a short description of the data file
  #
  # url: the link to the file if possible. If the data needs to be scraped,
  #      leave this property blank and set the "extraction_mode" to
  #      "web_scraper".
  #
  # path: leave blank if there's a url link to the data-file. If there's no
  #       link to the file but you can download it by clicking through
  #       a user-interface, then do so and then specify its path here.
  #       The path is the *relative path* (starting from this file). So if you
  #       put the data-file in the same folder, it's just the filename.
  #
  # publication_date: the date that the data was published
  #
  # publication_version: should clearly distinguish this data-file from others.
  #
  # periods: the "official" fiscal periods that the data-file covers.
  #
  # extraction_mode: set one of the options to "true" and the rest to "false"
  #
  # constants: Some of the fields we're trying to collect may be constant. Take
  #            the currency for example: it may not be mentioned in the data
  #            because it's common to all rows. Identify as many constants as
  #            you can.
  #
  # fields: the columns in the data table. Describe them as best you can.
  #
  # Good luck!
