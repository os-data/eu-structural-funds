title: European ESIF Funds Beneficiaries 2000-2020

description: >
  Structural and Cohesion Funds are financial tools set up to
  implement the regional policy of the European Union. They aim to reduce
  regional disparities in income wealth and opportunities. The overall budget
  for the 2007-2013 period was €347 billion according to Wikipedia. This
  repository is a data pipeline. It channels information about the beneficiaries
  of the funds into the Open-Spending datastore. The goal is to provide a
  unified dataset that is easy to visualize and query so that citizens and
  journalists can follow the money on a local and global scale. This project
  is a collaborative effort between Open-Knowledge Germany Open-Knowledge
  International and a number of journalists and developers.
