# description: the place to put your notes, warnings, remarks and limitations

# sources: only meant as *documention*. Add as many as you want. The urls to

# contributors: Put yourself down(email and website are not obligatory).

# resources: a single source can have one or more data-files, called
#            "resources". Why? Because there may be regular data updates or
#            the data may be broken down by funds for example.

  # Describe each data-file:
  # ------------------------
  #
  # title: a short description of the data file
  #
  # url: the link to the file if possible. If the data needs to be scraped,
  #      leave this property blank and set the "extraction_mode" to
  #      "web_scraper".
  #
  # path: leave blank if there's a url link to the data-file. If there's no
  #       link to the file but you can download it by clicking through
  #       a user-interface, then do so and then specify its path here.
  #       The path is the *relative path* (starting from this file). So if you
  #       put the data-file in the same folder, it's just the filename.
  #
  # file:
  #  - publication_date: the date the data was published
  #  - coverage_period: the time span *actually*  covered by the data.
  #  - version: if you have multiple files, use this field to distinguish them
  #
  # scraper_required: if a scraper is required, set one of this option to true
  #
  # schema: if you have mulitple files with the same schema, you only need to
  #         define the schema once: i.e. just don't include the schema property
  #         at all for the next files.
  #
  # fields: The list fields (columns) that we upload to Open-Spending. Some
  #         fields correspond to columns and some may be constant. If the field
  #         is a column, copy/paste the *original* name inside "original_name".
  #         If the field is a constant, enter its value in the "value" field.
  #         You can't have both.
  #
  # Good luck!
