# 1. Describe the source metadata:
# -----------------------------
#
# title: A human readable title for your source
#
# language: the 2-digit language code of the document (e.g. en, fr, es...)
#
# sources: only meant as documention: add as many as you want (urls to
#          the actual data-files are in the resources section).
#
# scraper_required: if a web or PDF scraper is needed
#
# contributors: put yourself down (email and website are not obligatory).
#               Follow the simple formatting convention.
#
# resources: a single description file like this can describe more than one
#            resource (file or webpage) as long as the data is structured the
#            same. This happens when the data is split by fund or period for
#            example.
#
# Good luck!
