  # Describe the data table in the file that you sourced.
  # -----------------------------------------------------
  #
  # Rename this file as "name of the downloaded file.source.data.extension". An
  # example is "beguenstigtenverzeichnis2015_final.source.data.pdf". If there's
  # nothing you can download, then invent a name. Spaces are okay.
  #
  # You can have as many fields as you want. Describe them as best you can.
  #
  # The "path" is the relative path. Basically, it's just the filename if you
  # downloaded the file in the same directory. If downloading was impossible,
  # then ignore the path and just specify the "url". The data will be scraped by
  # someone else.
  #
  # The "publication_date" is the date of the last data update on the website.
  #
  # Last, "global_fields" are fields whose value is the same for all rows in the
  # data, like "currency". They are often omitted in the data table but specified
  # somewhere else. Please make sure that you fill in as many as you can.
  #
  # Good luck!
