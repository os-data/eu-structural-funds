ABOUT INFORMATION
Projects (“Progetti”) – Projects in OpenCoesione refer to initiatives funded within cohesion policies and defined with a single act (e.g. a contract, a call etc.). Each project has been assigned an Unique Project ID code (i.e. Codice Unico di Progetto,CUP).

Subjects (“Soggetti”) – It’s either a public or private subject (a public authority, a non-profit institution, an individual or an business) which has a role related to one or more projects. Roles managed are:

Programming Authority (Programmatore), the decision-maker(s) on the project financing. Usually it is a central or local government authority.
Recipients (“Attuatore”), i.e. those who are in charge for the execute the project. For European structural funds these relate to the “beneficiary” according to Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, who is also the recipient of the financial contribution. The recipient may cooperate with other subjects to execution of the project but in such case the monitoring system may not always track them.
Time – Start and end dates, both planned and actual ones. Information about times may sometime not be available even if the project has been completed.

Categories (“Temi sintetici”) – they are based on a grouping of the EU Priority themes (according to Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006): Research and Innovation, Competitiveness, Digital Agenda, Energy and energy efficiency, Environment and risk prevention, Occupation and workers mobility, Urban and Rural Regeneration, Natural, Cultural and Tourist Attraction, Transport and Infrastructure Networks, Child and Elderly People Care, Social inclusion, Education and Training, Public Administration Capacity Building.

Maps – Each project is located at the national, regional, county, or municipality level. Regional maps show all the projects located either at a regional or lower level. County maps show all the projects located at a county or lower level. Projects located at a national level are not indicated on any map. Projects located in multiple places are shown in all the different levels where they are present. Maps also show the number of projects located at each level and the corresponding amount of resources established (total public sector funding and actual expenses).
