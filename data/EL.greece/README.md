The detailed data for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), European Social Fund (ESF) and Cohesion Funds for the period 2007-2013 are  here: http://anaptyxi.gov.gr/Default.aspx?tabid=251&language=en-US. It is a REST API, so it will need scraping.

For less detailed data on the same period, this is the link: http://anaptyxi.gov.gr/Analytika2.aspx?mod=1&~. It is a searchable database whose results can be downloaded as an .xls file.

The downloadable data for the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) for the period 2014-2020 are here: https://www.espa.gr/el/Documents/ListOfOperations_20160513.csv. Except for the names of the columns (both in English and Greek), the whole file is in Greek.
