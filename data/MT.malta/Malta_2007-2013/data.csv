However, it is generally estimated that at least 65% will complete their training successfully and become certified. It is also intended to ensure that at least 18.7% will go on to participate in further training and or find employment on completion.","The Employability Programme incorporates a collection of initiatives that are being proposed by the corporation to satisfy the needs of different client groups to further develop their skills and competencies tied to employability. It will aim to satisfy the following clients needs: 1. for persons with little or no skills or qualifications - the provision of basic, remedial skills and vocational training in a particular occupation will help individuals to take on further learning opportunities and hence become employable; 2. for those in employment interested in upgrading their skills will be assisted through the skills upgrading and retraining programmes. These programmes will be organised in vocational areas for which there is a labour market need. The resultant effect of such training is twofold, it will help those in employment, especially those in the lower end of the qualification structure to sustain their position in the labour market and further more it will contribute towards Malta's competitiveness rate. 3. the Jobseekers - through this programme, training sessions on job seeking skills (letter, CV writing, and interviewing skills) will be delivered on a regular basis. The aim of these sessions will be to empower and activate job seekers and as a result be in a position to seek sustainable employment. In addition, to these sessions workshops will be organised to help those needing additional assistance and with whom we would need to adopt a more personalised approach; 4. for job seekers - traineeships that would include a combination of on-the-job and off-the-job training will be provided. Traineeships will be provided in occupational areas in which there is a demand. These schemes have proved to be very successful as participants are exposed to real life situations at employers' establishments; 5. persons interested in being accredited for their prior learning - a number of occupational standards will be developed in consultation with employers and assessments sessions will be undertaken. This is in line with the proposals being made by Malta Qualification Council; 6. assisting persons to attend training programmes (not organised by the corporation) which will equip them with the right skills which help them to adapt to the changing needs of the labour market - financial assistance will be offered."

These historic ramparts from an integral part of the Maltese landscape and are also important architectural and cultural monuments in their own right. Most of our tourism product is sold around the unique iconographic and visual power that these monuments provide. These fortifications are, and have been for a very long while, a core feature of the Maltese tourism product that is widely used to publicise the island's assets on all tourists brochures. Yet, despite their inherent historical and architectural significance, and importance to tourism, the larger parts of these historic ramparts are to be found in a very poor state of preservation, owing largely to the inability, to date, to address the line scale and magnitude of the task of restoring such massive works and more importantly, the inequality  of the limited resources that have been available so far as to maintain and repair these extensive works. Owing to their present consumed and decayed state, therefore, these prime and highly visible fortifications are both visually unattractive and as such do little to promote Malta's brand image and claim as a cultural destination. It is to be stressed that in various places the poor state of the fortifications serves as a cause for ridicule and concern owing to the high degree of erosion, vegetation, structurally instability, misuse and treat to public safety, when instead, those historical ramparts should be a source of national pride and identity. The effort that s necessary to redress this state of affairs can only materialise with the assistance provided by ERDF support. The project for the restoration of the fortifications of Valletta, Birgu (with parts of the intra-mural spaces), sections of the fortifications of Mdina and the Gozo Citadel is designed to bring these important cultural and touristic sites back to an acceptable standard of presentation, whereby they will once again require their due attractiveness, dignity, architectural legibility and visual power, important aspects that have suffered considerably over the past decades. The investment provided by this project will upgrade the quality of the fortifications as prime tourism sites. The proposed restoration works, once completed in their totality, will also serve to recuperate various areas currently unutilised and make them available for culture activities or their purposes, thereby adding to their overall rehabilitation and greater integration into the tourism product that the Maltese islands have to offer. The project will help revalorise the image of the fortifications and allow Malta to retain its competitive edge in the cultural tourism sector. The project's impact on tourism, and on the overall economy in general, therefore, will be largely at the macro level, since the restored fortifications will enable a better image of the tourism product that the country already has on offer.","The main primary and underlying concern in promoting this project has always been the restoration of the decaying architectural fabric of the fortifications (135,000 metres squared of restored rampart elevation). The most important result is that the fortifications, once restored, will once again regain their architectural and cultural integrity befitting prime cultural-tourism sites; integrity that has been diminished over the years owing to the processes of decay, urbanisation, and pollution brought about the various factors. The restored fortifications will provide renewed opportunities for revalorisation and reuses by other stakeholders. In many ways this project is akin to the repair of an extensive, but rundown, network of arterial roads once repaired, these would improve traffic flow, reduce accidents and ultimately facilitate commerce. The possibility of offering tours around the fortifications should be pursued in the future, however, it can only materialise after the fortifications have been repaired and restored in their totality, and not during the duration on the project both for safety and aesthetic reasons. As such, this and other related activities which will be able to materialise after completion of the project cannot be used to measure and judge the success of the restoration project. The very benefit to tourism that will accrue from this project lies squarely in MRRA ability to restore the very fabric if these fortifications. It makes little sense for a country which seeks to promote its cultural assets, particularly as part of its tourism product) and its brand name when it then presents its prime assets in a neglected and consumed state of repair. As for the improved accessibility that will result from certain aspects of this project, this will be in the form of the recuperation of some of the unused areas of the fortifications in question, including underground passage ways which link the ditches to the interior of the ramparts","The projects intends to achieve the following objectives for each of the four chosen sites: Valletta: The main scope of the project is the restoration of the Bastions and masonry revetments and the scraped bedrock of the main bastioned front of Valletta - a world heritage site - together with its outer screen of counterguards and advanced works. The project also seeks to identify and promote the spaces within the fortifications in such a way so as to maximise the cultural potential of the fortifications. Birgu: The main scope of the project is to restore and rehabilitate the Birgu fortifications, in such a manner as to re-establish the physical connections in the Cottonera area between the Birgu seafront, Bormla and Kalkara seafront. Mdina: The main scope of this project is to consolidate the fragile terrain on which the bastion walls and historic places such as the Vilhena Palace at the entrance to Malta's medieval capital city are built in order to diminish and possibly stop further settlement and damage of these historic legacies. Gozo Citadel:  The main scope of this project is to restore and repair the ramparts of the Cittadella and to consolidate the fragile face and medieval ramparts on the northern part of the enceinte."

","Flash flood events in Malta involve directly and indirectly all economic, productive and life sectors of the Maltese Island. In general, even if the problem is more acute in certain areas of the island such as the Birkirkara, Msida, Gzira, Marsa and Marsascala catchment areas, the effects spread on all surrounding country engaging indirectly almost all Maltese population (circa. 410,000 residents).The NFRP tackles four different catchments namely the Birkirkara-Msida, Gzira, Qormi-Marsa and Marsascala basins, wherein are found the nine worst-hit localities, namely Msida, Birkirkara, Balzan, Gzira, Qormi, Marsa, Zebbug, Marsascala and Zabbar. These areas are identified among the top priority areas in the Storm Water Master Plan and also represent the areas where the majority of damages occurred in the last major storm that hit the Maltese Islands in September 2003. The NFRP will address flooding problems holistically at a catchment level, and also regionally by managing runoff across catchments. The proposals go beyond the local-problem focus; they address the interconnections between problems in different localities and also seek to connect drainage solutions of adjacent basins together, to achieve greater cost-effectiveness and hydraulic efficiency, while also optimising the scope for future water conservation. The NFRP also addresses the institutional dimension of the problem by including measures to strengthen the existing planning, management and maintenance responsibilities into an identifiable and more formal organisation. It is envisaged that through the implementation of the NFRP a turning point will be brought about in storm water management in the Maltese Islands, at the functional infrastructure level and in the operation and maintenance of the new system."

It is active and conscious development of a future oriented, value driven strategic, communicative and managerial process of accepting and using certain differences and similarities  in people (example: differences in race, nationality and not just gender) as a potential in organisation - a process which created added value to the company and the workers. Unlike equality, diversity management deals with all the various dimensions of diversity amongst individuals, such as educational background, age, gender, rate, nationality, cultural backgrounds marital status, political belief, disability, work status, corporate culture. Evidently the tourism workforce is nowadays characterised by diversity (example: different nationalities being employed) leading to a workforce of current employees and employers who need to adapt to this reality to ensure that proper services are provided. It is important to highlight that the project is not simply focusing on the element of female participation in the tourism labour market but also takes into consideration the participation of unemployed and inactive persons. This is because employees need to understand each other's and the organisation (corporate) culture and vice-versa to improve the employee-employer relationship. This will help employees to work well together thereby reducing the risk of labour turnover and hence retention of staff. It also helps the relationship between employees and guests since staff will be able to provide a better service to guests of different nationalities and cultures. Through this project, tourism operators will be sensitised to the benefits of utilising diversity management practices as innovative and creative ways of organising work arrangements (e.g.: working conditions, work-life balance, flexi-working, multi-tasking job sharing etc.) thus attracting individuals towards this industry and developing further the potential of those already engaged within the industry but are not optimally operating due to organisational barriers."
