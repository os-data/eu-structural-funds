The detailed data for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), European Social Fund (ESF) and Cohesion Funds for the period 2007-2013 are here: https://investinginyourfuture.gov.mt/projects

It is a webpage organized by categories, and each category has a list of the projects. Each project
lives on its own URL. The data of the project needs to be scrapped, although itÂ´s pretty consistent
and should be easy.
