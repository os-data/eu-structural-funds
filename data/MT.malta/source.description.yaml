            e.g. OPIIPA2 Continuous training and education. This field looks
            like a concatenation of Operational Programme II and Priority Axis
            2. It's unclear what Operational Programme II refers to since there
            is only one Operational Programme listed for Malta for the period
            2007-2013. Also the description after the code cannot be cross
            reference to any other description. So this field is not mapped.
