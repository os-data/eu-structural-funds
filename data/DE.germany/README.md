Data for Germany
=========================
Structure Funds are collected per region: http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/atlas/germany
The general landing page is here:http://www.bmwi.de/DE/Themen/Europa/strukturfonds.html

For the ESF, we found both national and regional data-files. After discussing whether to include the national files, we decided against it. We understood from our research that ESF funds were distributed on regional level, so that is why we let the regional ESF beneficiary lists take precedence over this national data file. 

For your information these are the data-files found.
