The detailed data for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and European Social Fund (ESF) for the period 2007-2013 are here: http://www.fonds-europeens.public.lu/fr/projets-cofinances/index.php

It is a webpage with a list of the projects paginated. Each project lives on its own URL.
The data of the project needs to be scrapped, although itÂ´s pretty consistent
and should be easy.

TODO: find the information for 2014-2020 projects
