The landing page for all of the Bulgarian ESIF data is http://www.strukturnifondovi.hr/projekti.
The data is available via a separate portal: http://umispublic.government.bg/prProcedureProjectsInfo.aspx?op=-1&proc=-2&clear=1 

On the portal, all projects (2007-today) can be downloaded in one xls file (36.2MB). This file does, however, not feature several important columns such as date, fund, etc. In the online view, each listed project contains a link that leads to a separate page with detailed contract information (Identification, Description, Partners, Indicators, Summary). The links may not be visible in the downloaded XLS file!
