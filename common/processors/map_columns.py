"""Map raw field names to fiscal field names where possible.

The mapping is determined by the property `maps_to` in the description file.
Since the general assumption is that all resources in the description file
have the exactly the same data structure, we just grab the mapping for the
first resource.

When building the lookup table, we check that:
    1. The property `maps_to` exists
    2. It's not empty
    2. Its value matches a fiscal field
